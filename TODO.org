# TODO

* Cleanup
** cleanup all the string manipulations bindings
*** maybe a transient menu that shows all the manipulations? (so it would open with var_name, varName, VarName)
** for all my custom actions: make everything work on either the current region or smart "thing at point"
*** go to actions
*** string manipulation actions
**** make these smarter per mode
***** python: snake case and ClassCase, etc
***** ts: camelCase ClassCase, etc
** clean up the indent tool binding
*** bind such that there's consistent behavior that indents the region left or right if there's region
*** left indent and a good binding
*** right indent and a good binding
*** C-c used to do crux duplicate but that's gone now?
** look for other ways to clean up my custom files, suggest
* Add modes
Generic modes that wrap their stupid cli clients
Should be VERY explicit about if it's local or live
Goal: quick visibility and access that does not break flow or get in the way
Goal: get me quick sexy access from inside emacs so that I don't have to open
gnome-terminal so much
** vercel
** supabase
* Enhance modes
Layer project specific stuff on top of the generic modes
Goal: quick visibility and access that does not break flow or get in the way for
this project
** vercel
*** for crewcapable usage patterns
** supabase
*** for crewcapable usage patterns
** aws
*** for crewcapable usage patterns
* Indent
 * does not indent by 4 in python mode
 * by 4 should be the default
 * nor in text mode
 * not in ts
 * furthermore, "C-c >" only works one time and then I have to "C-c >" again
   but I want it to be EASY to indent twice (meaning I don't have to C-c before
   each ">"), in fact if there were a "move this region around" mode that I
   could enable that would be great, maybe there's a package like that?
